THE BUSINESS CASE : 
A point of sale (POS) system tracks orders and calculates sale amount. It is designed to 
assist in both point of sale and inventory functions. You have taken a new job at a small 
online retailer that sells apps through an alternate app store. The previous programmer 
created a very simple POS for your organization – too simple. It’s time to build a system 
that will allow you to run analytics, handle refunds, and provide support. These are 
problems that the organization was too young and naïve about before, so now they must
innovate.
Your goal is to rework the relational database to make it more robust. To do so, you will 
create a server, load data, add stored procedures, use transactions, create triggers, 
specify views, and write advanced queries. Once you have completed the development 
in a simple environment, you will create a clusters of database servers to allow the 
application to scale.
